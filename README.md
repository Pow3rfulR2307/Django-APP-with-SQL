A very simple Django application for a university project of a freelancers website. The files in this repository include the basics of the back-end application (no front-end)
like the urls, settings, models, views etc... The purpose of using Django was to learn the framework since its popularity has been increasing considerably in the past few years.
While not perfect by any means, this was just the starting point for understanding the capabilities of a modern back-end framework and its features for accelerating development processes.
